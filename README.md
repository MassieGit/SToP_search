**SToP Clinic Data Analysis**

The purpose of his project is to extract pre-specified diagnoses using search strings and remove replications, including repeat presentations for the same condition, from electronic community clinical data, which is comprised of Medications (prescriptions) and Progress notes (clinical diagnosis, signs and symptoms). The data comes from clusters of communities that were involved in the SToP Trial focusing on skin presentations, skin related diseases and their treatments.
